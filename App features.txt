Blood donation app reviewes:
1. Friends2Support.org(4.2 rated)
	Review by users:
	suggestions to get more things done very easily, sending the requirement of blood to all people by personal messages would be a time taking task, so i here with suggest the app developers to add features so that those who want blood can give a message with all the details and just post in app, so the same message gets delivered to all the registered donors, like a message of group chat in whatsapp. 

	Another feature is to put in available or not available mode.

What i have found is - Bad user interface in all these apps

Features in the application:
Two options at the start of the app - Donor or Reciever/ Emergency blood required or Build donor profile. 
Build donor profile leads to - a user authentication interface, Asks for 
Name - 
photo -
Phone no -(hidden)
Blood type - 
Adhar/other authentication techniques
Once the user authentication is done, Profile is visible to the user as well as profiles of many users 
Rank system for those who have donated more blood - Gamification 

Emergency - Reciever:(Always visible in the top even if it is Donor)
- Nearest blood banks(via google maps)
- Nearest blood donors(hard problem)
Once blood recieved - Donor gets reward points or it appears - Number of lives saved - <number of blood donations>
